Hackerspace(.org.au)
================================================================================

This is a Drupal make based source for the Hackerspace(.org.au) project being
currently developed by the Ballarat Hackerspace.

[Drush (DRUpal SHell)](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush) is required to build
a usable codebase from this repository with the following command:

`drush make https://raw.github.com/ballarat-hackerspace/hackerspace/master/stub.make hackerspace`

This is still very much in development.
